## 🔊 **Fixed: Intro Video Now Has Sound**

**Problem:** Video was muted by default  
**Solution:** Video now plays with sound automatically

**Fallback:** If browser blocks autoplay with sound, a play button appears

---

## ✍️ **Fixed: Copy is More Personal**

**Removed generic explanations:**
- ❌ "With intention, not impulse" (was you explaining to me)
- ❌ "Our Journey / Our Story / Seven chapters" (too generic)

**Simplified to:**
- ✅ Hero: Just "For Adufe"
- ✅ Letter: "With Intention"
- ✅ Videos: "Us"
- ✅ Carousel: "My Favorite Memories"
- ✅ Finale: Just the question

**Result:** More intimate, less "website-y"

## 🎨 **Colors Confirmed**

Your style = Her style:
- Black (#000) and white (#FFF) base
- Dark purple (#4A1D96) - subtle accent
- Dark gold (#B8860B) - sophistication
- No bright colors
