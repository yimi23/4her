## 🎬 **1. Added Playback Speed Controls**

**What:** She can now watch videos at different speeds

**Where:** Below the chapter buttons in the video player

**Options:**
- 1x (normal)
- 1.25x (slightly faster)
- 1.5x (faster)
- 2x (double speed)

**How to use:**
- Click the speed button (1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 2x)
- Active speed shows in gold
- Speed persists across chapters

**Why:** She can watch at her own pace - faster if she wants, normal if she prefers

## ✍️ **2. Removed Generic Copy**

**Cleaned up explanations that were me talking to you:**

**Removed:**
- ❌ "Us" (section title before videos)
- ❌ "My Favorite Memories" (carousel title)

**What's left:**
- ✅ Hero: "For Adufe"
- ✅ Letter: "With Intention"
- ✅ Videos: Just chapter numbers (01-07)
- ✅ Carousel: Just the memories (no title)
- ✅ Finale: "Will you be my Valentine? Adufe"

**Result:** More minimal, less "website-y", more intimate

## ⌨️ **3. Bonus: Keyboard Shortcuts (Finale Video)**

**Hidden feature for finale video:**
- Press `+` or `=` to speed up (max 2x)
- Press `-` to slow down (min 0.5x)

Works when finale video is playing.

## 🎨 **Design Update**

**Speed control styling:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Chapter 01    [1x 1.25x 1.5x 2x]  0:00/7:23  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- Small buttons
- Gold when active
- Subtle, not distracting
- Matches overall aesthetic

## 🎯 **What Changed**

### **Before:**
```
Hero: "For Adufe - With intention, not impulse"
Videos: "Our Journey - Our Story - Seven chapters of us"
Carousel: "Cherished - My Favorite Memories - The moments..."
Speed: Fixed at 1x
```

### **After:**
```
Hero: "For Adufe"
Videos: Just chapter numbers (01-07)
