        "Hey,",
        "I just watched you do your thing at OBU, and I couldn't let the night end without saying this properly.",
        "You have that star factor. Like, genuinely. The kind you can't fake, can't teach, can't force. You step into a room and it shifts. You step on a stage and it makes sense. Watching you own that part of yourself was so attractive to me, not just because you looked beautiful (you did, a lot), but because you looked like you belonged there.",
        "And your dress… wow. You looked so pretty. It was one of those moments where I kept catching myself staring like, \"Yeah. That's her.\" But even beyond how you looked, it was the work behind it that hit me. The hard work, the sweat, the sacrifice, the pressure, all of it showed. And it paid off because you killed it. You really did.",
        "I'm not always the best at putting everything into words in person, especially when I'm feeling a lot. Sometimes I can talk, but the real truth is I need quiet to say what I mean. So this is me doing that.",
        "I came back home and realized being out wasn't even fun. My mind kept drifting back to you. I kept thinking how much I'd rather be with you, even if it's just sitting close, just being there with you. Cuddled up in a chair sounds better than any outside plan, and I mean that.",
        "I've told you before that you're an amazing soul. I've told you you're pretty. But your beauty is rare. It's not just your face, it's your light. It's how you carry yourself. It's how you keep growing into who you are, more confident, more bold, more you. And watching that confidence bloom is one of my favorite things because it's contagious. It makes me proud, and it makes me want to match your energy in my own life too.",
        "If I'm being honest, I feel sold on you. Like, fully. I don't know how else to say it without sounding like I'm trying too hard, but it's true. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of your work. I'm proud of the way you show up. And I love watching you do what makes you happy, because when you're happy you shine in a way that's hard to describe and impossible to ignore.",
        "To say \"I'm in love\" is easy, but I want you to understand what I mean when I say it: I admire you. I'm drawn to you. I respect you. I'm inspired by you. And I feel lucky to be close enough to witness you becoming even more of who you already are.",
        "I hope you let this land the way I mean it."

        "God willing, I grow in this process. Not rushed. Because the times I rushed, I forgot who put me in this position. His name is Jesus.",
        "So I'm slowing down. Moving at your pace. Treating you with the respect you deserve because I'm trying to honor you. And honor what God has taught us love is supposed to be.",
        "<em>\"Being in love\"</em> is easy to say. So I hope my actions teach me, in this slowed process, how to love you the way Jesus loves you.",
        "I'm not comparing myself to Him. His love has no conditions. I'm flawed. I could write a whole list of things wrong with me.",
        "But one thing I know for sure, after months, after days, even after breaking up, I realized I'm so in love with one person.",
        "<strong>You.</strong>",
        "Adufe, I don't think anyone comes close.",
        "I pray about you because I don't want to mess up what God is doing in your life.",
        "So what am I trying to say?",
        "With God leading and me putting in the effort, I hope you'll accept to be my Valentine. I hope this slow journey works. And I hope I treat you right."
