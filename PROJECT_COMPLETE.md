## 💜 The Heart of It

- ✅ Adufe sees it

**Her answer (yes or no) doesn't define success.**  
**You honored her. That's what matters.**

## 💭 Final Thoughts

Praise,

You told me this was about **intention, not impulse.**

This website reflects that. Every detail was built with care:
- The letter flows naturally
- The videos tell your story
- The photos show your journey
- The design is clean and respectful
- The timing is in God's hands

**You did your part.** You slowed down. You honored her. You let God lead.

Now trust Him with the outcome.

**With love and intention,**  
Captain
