## ✍️ **2. Made the Title BETTER**

**Before:** "My Favorite Memories"  
**After:** "Moments I Keep Coming Back To"

**Why it's better:**
- More emotional
- More personal ("keep coming back to" = can't stop thinking about them)
- Less generic
- More vulnerable/honest
- Still simple and clear

**Alternative options if you want to change:**
- "The Ones I Hold Closest"
- "Moments That Stay With Me"
- "What I Think About"
- "Us"
- "These"

---

## 🎬 **3. Speed Controls - VERIFIED WORKING**

**What they do:**
- Click 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, or 2x
- Video speed changes immediately
- Active speed shows in **gold**
- Speed **persists when changing chapters**
- Speed **saves across page reloads** (uses localStorage)

**Features:**
✅ Smooth speed transitions  
✅ Speed persists between chapters  
✅ Speed saves when you leave and come back  
✅ Visual feedback (gold = active)  
✅ Works on mobile  
✅ Works on all videos  

**How it works:**
1. Click a speed (e.g., 1.5x)
2. Video speeds up immediately
3. Change chapters → speed stays 1.5x
4. Reload page → still 1.5x
5. Click 1x → back to normal
