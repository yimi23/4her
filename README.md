# 💜 For Adufe - A Valentine's Website

**Built with love and intention for Adepileola**

## 🎯 What This Is

A personal website asking Adufe to be Praise's Valentine. Not a gimmick. Not rushed. An intentional expression of love, growth, and faith.

## 📖 The Story

Praise and Adufe dated, broke up, but Praise realized she's the one. This website represents his growth - no more 2 AM emotional texts, no more rushing. Just honoring her, honoring God, and moving at her pace.
