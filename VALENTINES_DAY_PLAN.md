## 🔥 THE MINDSET

**This isn't about a perfect date.**  
**It's about showing up.**

You already showed creativity (website).  
Now show consistency (following through IRL).  

The website asked the question.  
The flowers on Feb 5 are the proof you meant it.  
The date on Feb 14 is the commitment.

**You got this. 💜**
