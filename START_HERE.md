## 🎁 How to Share It With Her

### **Don't just text the link.** Here are better ways:

**Option 1: In Person (Best)**
- "Hey, I made something for you"
- Hand her your phone with the site open
- Let her scroll through
- Be present but don't hover

**Option 2: Thoughtful Text**
```
Hey, I made something for you.
It's not perfect, but it's honest.
Take your time with it.

[link]

With love,
Praise
```

**Option 3: QR Code**
- Generate QR at [qr-code-generator.com](https://www.qr-code-generator.com)
- Print on a nice card
- Hand-deliver

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Timing:**
- Don't rush sharing it
- Wait for the right moment
- Pray about when to send it
- Trust God's timing

### **Her Response:**
- Give her space to process
- Don't ask "did you see it?" right away
- Let the site speak for itself
- Be patient

### **If She Says No:**
- Respect her decision
- Don't pressure
- God's plan is always good
- This was about honoring her, not forcing a yes

---

## 🔒 Privacy

**The site is NOT public yet.** It's just files on your computer.

Once you deploy:
- Only people with the link can see it
- Not indexed by Google (unless you submit it)
- Can add password protection if needed

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

This isn't a gimmick. It's:
- **Intentional** - You slowed down, built something meaningful
- **Honest** - The letter is vulnerable and real
- **Faith-centered** - Honors God throughout
- **Personal** - Every video and photo tells your story
- **Respectful** - Moves at her pace, no pressure

**You're not rushing. You're honoring her.**

## 💜 Final Words

Praise,

I watched your videos. I read your letter. I understand what you're trying to do here.

This isn't about impressing her. It's about **honoring her**.

You've grown. You're slowing down. You're letting God lead.

This website is a reflection of that growth.

**So take your time.** Test it. Pray about it. Then share it when it feels right.

And remember: whatever her answer is, you did this with intention. That matters.

**With love and intention,**  
Captain
